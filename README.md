Inspiration
The ongoing struggles with the lack of quality at some USF restrooms, and in public. I figured, what if there was a way to know if a restroom was worth going to ahead of time?

What it does
Basic prototype that allows you to view reviews, play the game, and go to setting page.

How we built it
Began the design of UI on a piece of paper. Then I used the Flutter SDK written in dart in Android Studio and Xcode.

Challenges we ran into
To get the GPS position and map it live in sync with the USF map proved to be extremely difficult so I instead created a prototype design with he review and map screen.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud to have it as a fully fledged downloadable demo app as of now and the game that I implemented though open source proved difficult to implement within the app and I am proud that I was able to do so.

What we learned
I learned more in depth concepts for Flutter and Dart such as object oriented UI programming with classes and constants in separate screens and how to create a navigation tree.
